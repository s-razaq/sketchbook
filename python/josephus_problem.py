'''
Josephus problem is a math puzzle with a grim description: n prisoners are standing on a circle, sequentially numbered
from 0 to n âˆ’ 1. An executioner walks along the circle, starting from prisoner 0, removing every k-th prisoner and
killing him. As the process goes on, the circle becomes smaller and smaller, until only one prisoner remains, who is
then freed.
