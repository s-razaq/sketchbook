# sketchbook
My personal sketchbook of implemented ideas inspired by [The Software Developer's Sketchbook](http://prog21.dadgum.com/202.html)

This sketchbook of implemented ideas isn't a paper book, but a collection of small programs. It could be as simple as a folder full of Python scripts or Erlang modules. It's not about being right or wrong; many ideas won't work out, and you'll learn from them. It's about exploring your interests on a smaller scale. It's about playing with code. It's about having fun.
