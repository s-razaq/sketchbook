# sketchbook
My personal sketchbook of implemented ideas inspired by [The Software Developer's Sketchbook](http://prog21.dadgum.com/202.html)

This sketchbook of implemented ideas isn't a paper book, but a collection of Python scripts. It's not about being right or wrong; It's about exploring  interests on a smaller scale. It's about playing with code. It's about having fun.
